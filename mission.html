				<p><q>The greatest gift of the garden is the restoration of the five senses.</q><br />
				 ~<cite>Hanna Rion</cite></p>

				<p>Our mission is as follows:</p>

				</div>

				<p>To support the principles of organic gardening, and to dispense 
				quality information on practices relating to organic gardening.</p>
				<p>To provide the reader with helpful information related to those 
				practices, including appropriate times to plant, methods of soil 
				treatment such as mulching and composting, and ways to preserve 
				the health of plants through methods such as companion planting and 
				the use of organic, natural pest control.</p>
				<p>To spread awareness of the advantages of organic methods of 
				gardening, as well as the disadvantages presented by chemical methods 
				of fertilisation and pest control, and to inform the reader of ways in 
				which the food produced by an organic garden will have superior 
				health and nutritive qualities over foods produced by inorganic and 
				chemical methods.</p>
				<p>The Organic Gardening in Tasmania website is aimed at a wide audience 
				of local Tasmanians, from children to the elderly, as gardening is a 
				hobby that can and will be enjoyed by people of all ages. This 
				target audience has heavily influenced the design and layout of our website.</p>

				<div class="imgleftcontainer">

				</div>

				<p>A simple, open, and spacious layout was chosen to be easy on the eye, 
				to hold the attention of younger viewers, and to provide an interface 
				that is easy to understand even for those who are not necessarily familiar 
				with the more complex aspects of the World Wide Web. The menu on the left 
				provides a simple and intuitive standard method for the user to 
				easily navigate to other sections, and may be accessed from any page on the 
				website.</p>
				<p>Bright, natural colours were chosen, once again to attract and hold the 
				attention of younger viewers, and to remain easy on the eye. The choices of 
				greens, browns, yellows and oranges are also intended to simulate the colours one 
				might find in a home garden, as this is the subject with which our site is 
				concerned. Lighter shades were used to prevent the colour scheme from becoming 
				too gaudy and overwhelming. In particular, the lighter colours used for the 
				sections containing the main text content and the simple black used for 
				the text itself were chosen to preserve readability of the text and to avoid 
				straining the reader's eyes. Large and simple sans-serif fonts were used to 
				ensure that the site is easily read by older visitors and those who may 
				have trouble reading smaller type.</p>
