				<p>The purpose of this website is to provide a starting point 
				and reference for those seeking to undertake the rewarding 
				hobby of organic gardening. With a little bit of work and a lot 
				of care even the smallest patch of ground can be transformed 
				into an organic garden filled with lush growth. Whether you 
				intend to grow herbs, flowers, fruit or vegetables, for yourself 
				or your family or friends, this site can serve as a guide.</p>
				<p>We provide planting guides and handy tips to help you choose 
				what will work best in your own little space, be it a tiny garden 
				box or an entire backyard vegetable garden. Furthermore, our 
				tips and information are tailored to the unique seasons and climate 
				of Tasmania, so you know they will work best for you and allow 
				you to take full advantage of each growing season.</p>
				<p>In addition to a planting guide, we will also provide you with 
				convenient tips on companion planting, natural pesticides and pest 
				control, soil treatment, crop rotation, mulching, and composting. 
				To the left you will find our navigation menu, which will allow
				you to peruse the different sections of our site at your own leisure.</p>

				<p>Chemical fertilisers and pesticides may provide short term results, 
				but in the long run they rob the soil of nutrients and may even kill 
				living creatures that would otherwise be beneficial to 
				your garden. By using natural organic methods, you will 
				insure the longevity of your garden and the health of your plants. 
				Because it will be grown by your own hand in a clean and organic 
				fashion, you can be assured that the products of your garden will be 
				as fresh and nutritious as possible.</p>
				<p>So prepare to put on your gardening gloves and get out your shovel, 
				trowel, and rake! It's time to get your hands dirty, put in some hard 
				work, and hopefully have a lot of fun in the process. The end result will 
				be a delightful organic garden that will be a source of pride and 
				pleasure, and will also supply your home with an endless output of 
				tasty and refreshing produce.</p>
				<p>We hope our site provides opportunities for learning, and 
				that it aids you in your desire to grow healthy and delicious 
				vegetables and herbs in a clean, organic environment.</p>
				<p>Enjoy browsing. We would love for you to visit us again in the future!</p>
